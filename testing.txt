Testing
=======

Methods:

bool assert(bool, string)
    Takes a boolean argument and a string argument.
    bool: The property you are testing. E.g.,

        80 == 80
        "Hello, world" != "Goodbye, world"

    string:
        The name of the test. E.g.,

        "Test of string constructor"
        "Test that 80 is equal to 80"
    Methodology:
        If the bool is true, it prints:
            Test passed: {string}
        If the bool is false, it prints:
            Test failed !!! : {string}


bool assert_false(bool, string)
    Exact opposite of assert(). It tests if a boolean is false.

    Methodology:
        If the bool is false, it prints:
            Test passed: {string}
        If the bool is true, it prints:
            Test failed !!! : {string}

bool assert_equal_int(int, int, string)
    Tests for equality of two ints.

    Methodology:
        Exactly the same as assert(), except that it checks for integer equality.

bool assert_equal_string(string, string, string)
    Tests for string (std::string) equality.
